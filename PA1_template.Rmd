Activity Monitoring Data Analysis
=================================

What follows is a data analysis of an activity monitoring device. The data are data collected by an activity monitoring device worn by an anonymous individual. The data was collected at 5 minute intervals through out the day during the months of October and November 2012. Included is the number of steps taken in each 5 minute interval.

```{r init, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
## create the directory if it does not exists. 
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
    dir.create("./data")
}

zipFileNm <- "./data/activity.zip"
dLoadFileNm <- "./data/sourceDt.RData"

## if the zip file does not exist download the file
if (!file.exists(zipFileNm)) {
    # this file stores the date when the archive was downloaded
    
    url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
    download.file(url, destfile = zipFileNm)
    
    # extract the archive
    unzip(zipFileNm, overwrite=TRUE, exdir="./data")
    
    # update the date the file was downloaded
    downloadDtTm <- format(Sys.time(), "%b %d %Y at %H:%M:%S")
    save(downloadDtTm, file = dLoadFileNm)        
} else {
    load(dLoadFileNm, envir=environment())    
}

```

The data was downloaded from the url https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip. It was downloaded on **`r downloadDtTm`**. 

```{r loadProcData}
data <- read.csv("./data/activity.csv", header = TRUE)

# Convert the data field to a date
```

The read data consists of `r nrow(data)` rows and `r ncol(data)` columns. The column names are **`r names(data)`**.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
